## Flixpress.js Dev Mode

Presets functionality is housed inside the Flixpress.js library. To *create* presets, you must switch the library to "Dev Mode".

To turn on Dev Mode, either open your console and enter the command `Flixpress.devModeOn()` or drag the button below into your browser's bookmarks or favorites, then click that bookmark/favorite while on the page need Dev Mode for.

<a href="javascript:Flixpress.devModeOn();" style="padding: 8px; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 6px; color: black; background: #ccc; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold">FlixPress Dev Mode</a>

Dev Mode is not persistent, so you will have to turn it on again after every page refresh.
